  - `visualization/shadedErrorBar`: A visualization function to draw curve with shaded error bar.
- Part 2:
  - `loadDataset.m`:  a function to load the specific dataset from `data` folder
  - `classification.m`: the main function you will need to complete, which contains examples of: 
    - how to load the data 
    - a classification using LDA with Matlab's inbuilt tools
    - visualizations of the classification
  -  `visualization/draw_cm`: a visualization function to draw confusion matrices.
